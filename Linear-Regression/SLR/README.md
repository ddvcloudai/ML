- SLR algorithm solves a really simple linear model where there is no need to think much as per logic other than simply understanding the coding part that suffices the y=mx+c equation solution space, along with plotting and considering the overfitting and underfitting check. In this case model is good fit and not required to tweak the parameters. However, scope of improvement is always possible.
- The code files slr.py and slr2.py both code presends case study of predicting salary and house price respectively. Since in SLR, we consider only one independent variable, the only nature of model function is y=mx+c. However, in case of multiple column problems, our objective is to look either into polynomial regression or eliminating the irrelevant columns to bring it down to single independent variable problem.
- This basic SLR model presents more lucarative outcomes when applied over conplex data or big data. However, it caters an appropriate approach of best fit model when overfitting regularization is performed over relevant dataset. Make sure to proceed with server offering best processing speed when applying large dataset.
