SLR algorithm solves a really simple linear model where there is no need to think much as per logic other than simply understanding the coding part that suffices the y=mx+c equation solution space, along with plotting and considering the overfitting and underfitting check. In this case model is good fit and not required to tweak the parameters. However, scope of improvement is always possible
Performing Simple Linear Reg Models. This basic SLR model presents more lucarative outcomes when applied over conplex data or big data. However, it caters an appropriate approach of best fit model when overfitting regularization is performed over relevant dataset. Make sure to proceed with server offering best processing speed when applying large dataset.
